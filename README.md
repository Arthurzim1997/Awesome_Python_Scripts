**[EthicalHackingScripts](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts/tree/main/EthicalHackingScripts)** - This repository would include all the python based scripts which can be used as Ethical Hacking Tools.

When raising an issue, do make sure to mention the kind of script, project title, short description of the project and how would you expect it to work. As a good practice, always link the issue number with pull request. (#issue number : Give this details when you raise a PR).

If you worked on or want to initiate a unique project and share it with the world, you can do that here. Go through the contributing guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING_GUIDELINES.md)👩‍💻

Subsequently, also go through the GitHub documentation on [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).


## 🌱 Pre-requisites

- Python IDE : Install it by using this link [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- If you are new to python programming and want to have a fair knowledge before you start working on it, you can learn it in a simplified way through this [repository](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Learn-Python-For-Beginners).
- To make you familiarize with how programming works in python with proper structuring and algorithms, here I present a [project](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/PyAlgo-Tree) created specifically for contributors who wants to explore and practice their concepts.


## 🛠 Templates to Follow

- [Feature request](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/.github/issue_template/feature_request.md)
- [Bug Report](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/.github/issue_template/bug_report.md)
- [Pull Request](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/.github/pullrequest_template.md)
- [README](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/.github/readme_template.md)

**Note** : One should follow these templates while creating a new issue or pull request. 


## 📝 Project Structure

Your projects should contain this flow to maintain similarity across all other projects. Make sure to note these things, before you create a PR.

Create a folder of your project title. (Example : If you want to add a game of tic tac toe, then project name should be "Tic Tac Toe" and file name as "tic_tac_toe.py")

The project repository you had created would have :

**file_name.py** - This python file is the project you have worked upon.

**README.md** - This file is must included to get good understanding of the project (Elaborate it briefly about how it works using [README](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/.github/readme_template.md) template).

**requirements.txt** - In this file, you should add all the libraries you had included in your project 

**Images** - This folder would have all images added, be it screenshots or step by step process images.

**Related files** - The other additional and related files would be added up in "Related" folder.


## ⚙️ Things to Note

* Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources because that work will not be considered. Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.
* You can only work on issues that have been assigned to you.
* If you want to contribute the script, it's preferable that you create a new issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
* If you have modified/added code, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
* Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in the correct folder.
* Add Screenshots to help us know what this Script is all about.
* Do not update the **[README.md](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/Awesome_Python_Scripts/blob/main/README.md).**


## 👨‍💻 Workflow:

- Fork the repository

- Clone your forked repository using terminal or gitbash.

- Make changes to the cloned repository

- Add, Commit and Push

- Then in GitHub, in your cloned repository, find the option to make a pull request.
